# Linear Regression: Predicting Insurance Premium Based on Age

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Linear Regression** model built using Python to predict a person's **Insurance Premium** based on their **Age**.  

The dataset contains two columns:  
- **Age**  
- **Insurance Premium**  

Since the dataset was already clean, minimal preprocessing was required. The main focus was to perform **basic EDA** and apply a regression model to predict outcomes.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- The dataset was clean, so only basic analysis was performed.
- Plotted graphs:
  - **Age vs Insurance Premium** (actual data distribution)
  - **Age vs Predicted Insurance Premium** (regression line fit)

---

## 🤖 Model
- A **Simple Linear Regression** model was trained.  
- The model takes **Age** as input and predicts the corresponding **Insurance Premium**.

---

## 🔮 Prediction
At the end of the notebook/script, you can **input your own Age**, and the model will predict the estimated insurance premium.
